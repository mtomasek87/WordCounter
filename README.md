# WordCounter

A work-in-progress Java application that let's the user paste(Ctrl-V) a block of text(max. 10 paragraphs) and
then enter a word. The application will count how many times the input word appears in the input text.

I'm still trying to figure out how to let the user input the number of paragraphs they want to paste into the console.
